# Bivaet Utilities
BivaetUtils is Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.20.1. It was originally made for my old Minecraft server, but now it's closed so I decided to publish it. It doesn't do much tbh, I was just trying to make something with Java and Spigot API. Plugin supports Russian Language only.

# Usage
`/mask` - Equip a mask, which hides your nickname above your head and replaces it with "Anonymous #num" in chat and TAB. It was created for CMI plugin, but it can be easily edited to work on Vanilla or EssentialX

`/fakechat [playerName] [message]` - Sends [message] in chat as [playerName]. playerName could be any player, even if it doesn't exist or never visited the server. Nice way to troll people or just do announcements. It should adapt to any chat plugin you have.
